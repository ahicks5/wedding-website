# Andrew & Lyndsey Wedding Website

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
Build a stunning, one-of-a-kind wedding website for Andrew & Lyndsey's August 2026 wedding in Austin, TX. This is NOT a generic wedding site — it should feel like a premium, bespoke digital experience with magazine-quality design, cinematic micro-animations, and buttery-smooth interactions. Think: editorial design meets luxury brand website. Every detail matters.

## TECH STACK (mandatory)
- **Framework:** Next.js 14+ with App Router and TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS 4 + custom CSS for advanced animations
- **Animations:** Framer Motion for scroll-triggered reveals, page transitions, parallax, hover states, and micro-interactions
- **Database:** Supabase (Postgres) for RSVP submissions and guest management
- **Deployment:** Vercel
- **Fonts:** Use elegant serif + clean sans-serif pairing (e.g., Playfair Display + Inter, or Cormorant Garamond + Montserrat)
- **Icons:** Lucide React
- **QR Code:** qrcode.react library
- **Image optimization:** Next.js Image component with blur placeholders

## DESIGN PHILOSOPHY
- Elegant, editorial, modern — NOT generic wedding template vibes
- Rich but restrained color palette (suggest: deep sage/olive, warm cream/ivory, soft gold accents, charcoal text)
- Generous whitespace, cinematic full-bleed hero images
- Typography-forward design — headlines should be art
- Subtle parallax scrolling, fade-in reveals on scroll, smooth page transitions
- Cursor-responsive elements where tasteful (subtle hover glows, magnetic buttons)
- Mobile-first responsive design — most guests will visit on their phones
- Loading transitions between pages (elegant crossfades, not spinners)
- Consider a custom cursor on desktop for extra polish
- Smooth scroll behavior throughout
- Image hover effects (subtle zoom, soft overlay transitions)

## SITE STRUCTURE & PAGES

### 1. HOME PAGE (`/`)
- Full-screen hero with engagement/couple photo, names in elegant typography
- Animated countdown timer to wedding date (stylish, not cheesy — think flip-clock or minimal numeric with label animation)
- Scroll down to reveal:
  - Wedding date, time, and day of week
  - **Ceremony details:** Church name, address, time (placeholder for now)
  - **Reception details:** Venue name, address, time (placeholder — likely Hotel Ella or similar Austin venue)
  - Embedded map or elegant address cards with "Get Directions" links
  - A beautiful couple photo section
  - Brief "Welcome" message
  - "The Weekend at a Glance" schedule overview (Friday welcome event, Saturday ceremony + reception, Sunday brunch — all placeholder)
- Smooth scroll-triggered animations for each section

### 2. OUR STORY (`/our-story`)
- Interactive scrollable timeline of Andrew & Lyndsey's relationship
- Design as a vertical timeline with alternating left/right content blocks
- Each milestone has: date, title, short description, and a photo placeholder
- Scroll-triggered animations — each milestone fades/slides in as you reach it
- Parallax photo sections between major milestones
- Placeholder milestones to fill in:
  - Where they each grew up
  - How they met
  - First date
  - Key relationship moments
  - The proposal
  - Engagement
- End with a "And now, the next chapter..." leading to wedding details
- Make this page feel like a mini documentary — cinematic and emotional

### 3. FAQ (`/faq`)
- Elegant accordion-style expandable questions with smooth open/close animations
- Placeholder questions:
  - What is the dress code?
  - Will the ceremony and reception be at the same location?
  - What time should I arrive?
  - Is there parking available?
  - Can I bring a plus one? (Refer to their invitation)
  - What's the weather like in Austin in August? (Hot! Suggest light fabrics)
  - Are kids welcome?
  - Can I take photos during the ceremony?
  - What if I have dietary restrictions?
  - Is there an after-party?
  - When is the RSVP deadline?

### 4. ACCOMMODATIONS (`/accommodations`)
- Card-based layout for recommended hotels/accommodations
- Each card: hotel name, photo placeholder, distance from venue, price range, booking link placeholder
- Sections:
  - **Recommended Hotels** (room blocks if applicable)
  - **Getting to Austin** — airport info (AUS - Austin-Bergstrom), flight tips
  - **Getting Around** — Uber/Lyft recommendation, rental car options, parking notes
  - **Things to Do in Austin** — brief local recommendations for guests making a trip of it (placeholder suggestions: South Congress, Lady Bird Lake, BBQ spots, live music)
- Map showing hotel locations relative to venue (or placeholder for this)

### 5. REGISTRY (`/registry`)
- Clean, minimal page
- Hero message: "Your presence is our greatest gift" or similar warm message
- Large, elegant buttons/cards linking out to external registry sites (placeholder URLs):
  - Amazon Registry
  - The Knot / Zola / other platform
  - Option for cash fund / honeymoon fund (link to Venmo/PayPal or registry platform that supports this)
- NOTE: All registries are external links — no e-commerce on this site
- Brief note about registry etiquette or a sweet message from the couple

### 6. RSVP (`/rsvp`)
- **This page requires Supabase database integration**
- Beautiful multi-step form with animated transitions between steps:
  - **Step 1:** Guest searches for their name (autocomplete from guest list in Supabase)
  - **Step 2:** Confirms their invitation details (who's in their party based on DB)
  - **Step 3:** Accepts or declines for each person in their party
  - **Step 4:** Meal selection (if applicable — placeholder options)
  - **Step 5:** Dietary restrictions / special notes (free text)
  - **Step 6:** Confirmation screen with animated checkmark and sweet thank-you message
- Form validation with elegant inline error states
- Success state saves to Supabase and could trigger email confirmation (future enhancement)
- **Admin consideration:** Build a simple `/admin` route (password-protected) where Andrew can view all RSVPs in a table, export to CSV, see response rates

### 7. CONTACT (`/contact`)
- Simple, elegant contact section (can be a page or footer section)
- "Questions? Reach out to us"
- Email link and/or simple contact form
- Optionally list wedding party contacts for day-of questions

### GLOBAL ELEMENTS
- **Navigation:** Sleek fixed header that changes on scroll (transparent → solid background). Hamburger menu on mobile with full-screen animated overlay. Desktop: minimal horizontal nav.
- **Footer:** Couple's names, wedding date, hashtag placeholder (#AndrewAndLyndsey or similar), and small links
- **Page transitions:** Smooth crossfade or slide transitions between all pages using Framer Motion + Next.js App Router
- **QR Code:** Generate a QR code component that links to the site URL — make it downloadable/printable for save-the-dates and invitations. Create a `/qr` utility page or include in admin.
- **Music:** Optional subtle background music toggle (OFF by default, user opt-in) — stretch goal
- **Accessibility:** Proper semantic HTML, alt tags on images, keyboard navigable, good contrast ratios

## IMPORTANT NOTES
- Use placeholder images from Unsplash (romantic/wedding themed) until real photos are provided
- All wedding details (dates, times, addresses) are PLACEHOLDER — mark them clearly with TODO comments
- The site should be fully functional with placeholder content
- Prioritize mobile experience — most guests will use phones
- Performance matters — optimize images, lazy load below-fold content, minimize bundle size
- The RSVP system is the most critical functional piece — it must work flawlessly
- Make the QR code easily accessible for printing on physical invitations
