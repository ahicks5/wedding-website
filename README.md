This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## RSVP Guest List Import

The guest list lives in **`Wedding_Guests_RSVP_Clean.xlsx`** (sheet `Guests`),
which is the single source of truth. `scripts/import-guests.mjs` syncs it into
Supabase. It is **idempotent and safe to re-run** — re-importing an edited file
updates the database in place and **never wipes RSVP responses guests have
already submitted**.

### How it works (two layers)

- **Imported tables** — `households` and `guests` are rebuilt from the sheet on
  every run (upserted on `household_id` / `guest_id`).
- **Response table** — `rsvps` is written *only* by the website, keyed on the
  stable `guest_id`. The importer never touches it, so responses always survive.
- Guests that disappear from the sheet are **soft-removed** (`removed = true`),
  never hard-deleted, so an existing RSVP can never be orphaned.

### One-time setup

1. Run the SQL migrations in the Supabase SQL editor, in order:
   `supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql`,
   `002_checklist.sql`, then `003_rsvp_guest_list.sql`.
2. Create `.env.local` (see `.env.local.example`) with:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=...
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=...   # secret, server-only
   ```

### Importing

```bash
npm run import-guests -- --dry-run     # preview the diff, write nothing
npm run import-guests                  # apply changes
npm run import-guests -- path/to.xlsx  # explicit file (default: the clean xlsx)
```

Each run prints a summary (inserted / updated / soft-removed / households /
placeholders) and any **non-fatal warnings** (missing/duplicate primary contact,
blank `side` on a confirmed guest, malformed zip). A dry run needs no database.

### The `guest_id` contract

`guest_id` (format `G###`) is immutable — **never renumber existing guests.**

- Add a guest in the sheet with a fresh `G###`, or leave it blank: the importer
  assigns the next available id and **reports it** so you can write it back into
  the sheet.
- `PLACEHOLDER_UNKNOWN` rows are real seats for unnamed plus-ones; the website
  lets the primary contact fill in the name at RSVP time (stored on
  `rsvps.plus_one_name`, not back in the sheet).

Run `npm test` to exercise the importer logic (`node --test`).


You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
